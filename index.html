        <p><strong>Park Ji-Sung</strong>; born 25 February 1981 is a South Korean former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He currently serves as club ambassador for Manchester United, for whom he played from 2005 to 2012. Born in Seoul, Park is the most successful Asian player in history, having won 19 trophies in his career. He is the first Asian footballer to have won the UEFA Champions League, to play in a UEFA Champions League final, as well as the first Asian to have won the FIFA Club World Cup. Park was able to play anywhere across the midfield and was noted for his exceptional fitness level, discipline, work ethic and off-the-ball movement. His remarkable endurance levels and pace earned him the nickname "Three-Lungs" Park.</p>

          <p>The great thing about Ji-sung Park is he's one of the best professionals we've had here.</p>
          <p>He was truly fantastic, and particularly in big games. I loved playing him in the big games. His record against Arsenal, for instance, was fantastic."</p>

          "He's a real players' player. Up there with best in the world for movement, and so intelligent and direct with runs off the ball. His work-rate is unreal, he adds a dimension no other player brings to the team. He's underrated, a real top player."
